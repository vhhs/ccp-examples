Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Input
* One line of integers (space separated) that make up the `nums` array
* A `target` integer

Output
* Two numbers in `nums` such that their sum is `target`

Example
* `2 7 11 15`, `9`: `2 7`
* `3 2 4`, `6`: `2 4`
